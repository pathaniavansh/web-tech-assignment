Design Decisions:

Color Scheme: I chose a dark header with white text for better readability and a professional look. The body has a light gray background to reduce eye strain and maintain focus on content.
Typography: I used Arial as the primary font for its readability across different devices. The font size and spacing were chosen to ensure comfortable reading.
Layout: The layout is clean and organized, with navigation links placed prominently at the top for easy access. Each section is clearly separated, making it intuitive for users to navigate.
Responsive Design: Media queries were used to make the website responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various screen sizes and devices.
Challenges Faced:

Form Validation: Implementing form validation in JavaScript posed a challenge, especially ensuring that all required fields are filled and that the input follows the correct format (e.g., email validation).
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Testing the website on different browsers revealed some inconsistencies in rendering, particularly with older versions of Internet Explorer. This required additional CSS tweaks to ensure proper display.
Responsive Design: Achieving responsiveness across all screen sizes and resolutions was challenging, especially for complex layouts. It required careful adjustment of CSS properties and extensive testing on various devices.
Optimization: Balancing aesthetics with performance was another challenge. Optimizing images and minimizing CSS and JavaScript files without compromising visual appeal required iterative refinement.
Overall, overcoming these challenges involved a combination of research, experimentation, and iterative development to ensure a polished and user-friendly website.
